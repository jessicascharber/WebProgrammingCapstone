              The small local town, a mile away, has an award winning meat market
              that frequently offers grilled pork chops on a stick. The local sports bar
               has excellent quality food as well.
              Most anything you need can be found within a 15 minute drive to Monticello.

            <p>This family owned cabin is cared for with love. In order
              for our family to continue to be able to enjoy this home together,
               we need to rent it out to help with the expense. We ask that you please treat our
                home with respect and understand that although we do require a security deposit,
                that is not enough to cover the cost of new furniture and carpet. Therefore,
                 we ask that food, drink and shoes be kept off of carpeted areas, with the
                 exception of the porch. </br> Thank you so much.
            </p>
            <p id="punderline">Please call us for more information - (763)350-2555</p>
